# Big_Data_Project


In this project, we explore the collaborative filtering method using latent factor decomposition, specifically through matrix factorization techniques, to break down user-item interactions for enhanced item recommendations using the Alternating Least Squares method. The research utilizes PySpark (version 2.4.0) and is initially conducted in a High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment before transitioning to a single-machine model to evaluate performance differences. Additionally, we employ several visualization techniques to uncover hidden relationships between latent factors and other attributes.
