# Big_Data_Project


In this project,
we conduct research on collaborative filtering approach with
latent factor decomposition, a matrix factorization approach
to decompose user-item interaction information to recommend usersâ€™ most relevant items, with Alternative Least
Square method. We utilize PySpark (version 2.4.0) and implement baseline model on HPC environment. We further
implement model on single-machine to compare its performance from HPC settings, and conduct various visualization
to detect the hidden correlations between latent factors and
other features.
